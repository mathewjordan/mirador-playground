# Mirador Playground

This application is a small React.js codebase that serves a contained environment for testing IIIF via a Mirador 3.1.1 viewer. To run, you'll just need current versions `npm` (Node.js) and `yarn`. 

## Playing

- `yarn && yarn start`
- open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
- the initially loaded manifest will render to Mirador

In your IDE, you can modify manifests at - Modify manifests at `./assets/iiif/manifest` and items at `./assets/item`. Content within `./assets` will be served to the root of the local development URL of http://localhost:8080.

To change the manifest being loaded by the Mirador viewer, update the state variable in `./src/App.js`

```
this.state = {
    manifest: 'http://localhost:8080/iiif/manifest/nezperce.json',
};
```

## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.131
In Santa Monica, California, latest in a long line is the Douglas DC-6 and

00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.568
Ben Howard, test pilot, demonstrates the reversible-pitch propellers

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:13.281
on the four-engine craft that add to both safety and ease of operation

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.275
on the ground. With the props in reverse pitch, the giant plane

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.038
could be slowed down during an emergency landing.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:24.891
Many other war-tested devices are incorporated in the luxury airliner

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.212
which ushers in a new era in American aviation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.141
56 passengers will travel in up-to-the-minute comfort onboard

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.323
this successor to the famous Skymaster.

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:50.665
Pressure cabins, sound proofing, traveling at a speed of 300 mph

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:54.009
in roomy cabins that can be quickly converted into

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.097
sleeping compartments for 26 passengers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.919
In this 20th-century magic carpet, you'll soon be able to laugh

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:10.008
at time and space and dream your way across the vastness

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.933
of a nation at 20,000 feet.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.481
An ancient chore in a modern setting!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.033
Everything snug as a bug in a rug, ready to call it a day

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.192
and tomorrow comes on wings of safety.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Bye now!
